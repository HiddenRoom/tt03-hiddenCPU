# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a set of registers to divide the clock, and then some combinational logic
      to convert from binary to decimal for the display.

      Puts a slower square wave output on output 7.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, registers will initialize, in order of ascending address, to 00000000b, 00000001b, 00000010b, 00000011b

# A description of what the inputs do
  inputs:               
    - clock
    - reset
    - opcode bit zero
    - opcode bit one
    - result reg address bit zero
    - result reg address bit one
    - non result operand reg address bit zero
    - non result operand reg address bit one
# A description of what the outputs do
  outputs:
    - bit zero of hardwired output reg number at address 11b
    - bit one of hardwired output reg number at address 11b
    - bit two of hardwired output reg number at address 11b
